Plan International is aware of an ongoing security situation involving three members of staff in South Sudan. They, along with aid workers from other humanitarian and UN agencies, went missing on 25 April when a convoy driving from Yei town to Tore in Central Equatoria disappeared. 

Plan International’s first priority is ensuring the safety of our staff members, who are all South Sudanese nationals, and the wellbeing of their families. We are working with partner organisations and the relevant authorities to secure a swift and safe resolution to the situation.

Due to the nature of the incident, we are limited in the information we can provide. Our updates will be guided by our paramount concern for safety and security of those involved.

Plan International has been working in South Sudan, including before its independence, since 2006 - helping poor children to access their rights to education, health, protection and economic security. The organisation works with more than 28,000 children to bring lasting improvements in a country that has suffered decades of conflict.
